# DrawAndGuess
Simple web application where one player draws an image and the others have to guess it.

# Important notes!
There is no register functionality for now and there is no Authentication for login! (Adding Bcrypt in the future)
There are 10 users in the database: aysam1, aysam2....aysam10 all with password 1234
You can always join as a guest.

# Game start
The game can only start when there are atleast 2 people online, the players whom aren't drawing must guess the word in the chat box.

### Deployed on heroku, might take a second or two on the first launch.
